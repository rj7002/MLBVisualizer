This is an interactive Streamlit app that uses MLB statcast data and plots in on a 3D Field. It uses the x and y coordinates of each hit to plot the trajectory of each hit. It uses the launch angle to create the arc of each hit. It also uses the pitching movement data to create 3D visualizations of the pitches thrown.
